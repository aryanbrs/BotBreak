# BotBreak - Call Break Game Bot

## Project Overview

BotBreak is a backend program designed to simulate a Call Break card game with modified rules. This bot autonomously plays the game, making strategic decisions based on the current game scenario.

## Key Features

1. **Autonomous Bot Gameplay**: Plays the Call Break game autonomously.
2. **Strategic Logic Functions**: Uses functions `func1()` to `func7()` for decision-making.
3. **Efficient Game Management**: Utilizes linked lists, queues, and arrays to manage players, cards, and game flow.

## Special Logic Strategies and Efficient Management

- **Starting Point**: Begins with `func1()` evaluating initial game conditions.
- **Decision Tree**: Calls the next relevant function based on evaluations.
- **Final Decision**: Ends with a leaf node function making the final decision.

The bot dynamically adapts to different game conditions and optimizes its moves through this hierarchical decision-making strategy.

## Key Functions

- **nextPlayer(wonPlayer)**: Manages the circular queue of players.
- **distribute()**: Randomly distributes cards for balanced play.
- **initialize()**: Sets up the game by initializing data structures and distributing cards.
- **control()**: Starts and manages the game's progression.

## Summary

BotBreak leverages strategic logic and efficient game management to provide intelligent and dynamic Call Break gameplay, ensuring fair play and efficient game management.
